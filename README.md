**🛠️ Starting Point: Free Web Proxies**

When I first encountered a website that blocked my attempts to scrape data, I decided to use free web proxies. At this point, I wasn’t very familiar with advanced methods, so proxies seemed like a simple solution. Proxies helped by making my requests appear as if they were coming from different IP addresses. 

Here’s what I did:

🔄 Used free web proxies like:

Proxy 1 🌐 : https://plainproxies.com/resources/free-web-proxy 

Proxy 2 🌐 : https://hide.me/en/proxy 

Proxy 3 🌐 : https://proxyium.com/ 

💡 This helped me scrape some websites that had basic protection based on IP rate-limiting.

While this approach worked for some time, I soon realized that many websites had more sophisticated detection mechanisms. Some sites blocked proxies or detected automated requests even with different IPs.

**🏗️ Next Step: Fake User Agents & Headers**

When free proxies didn’t solve all my problems, I moved to the next level: fake user agents and custom request headers. 

Here’s how I tackled it:

👤 Fake User Agent: I used libraries to randomize the User-Agent header so that each request looked like it was coming from a real browser. This helped evade basic bot detection systems.

📝 Custom Headers: I tweaked other headers, like Referer and Accept-Language, to match those sent by real browsers.

Example:

headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36',
    'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
}

This worked for a wider range of sites, but not all. Some websites were able to detect automated scripts despite these adjustments. 

**🕵️‍♂️ Advanced Techniques: Selenium Stealth**

To handle the sites that still blocked my requests, I found Selenium Stealth, a Python library that mimics human behavior while interacting with a website. 

Why this was a game-changer:

🎭 Human-like Interaction: Selenium Stealth makes the browser behave like a human user, hiding the fact that it’s controlled by a script.

🖱️ Clicking, Scrolling, Typing: Mimicking these behaviors helps bypass many automated bot detections.

I integrated Selenium Stealth and successfully scraped websites that previously blocked both free proxies and fake user agents. However, a new challenge arose when I tried running this setup on our server.

**🖥️ Headless Mode Issues: PyVirtualDisplay to the Rescue**

While Selenium Stealth worked great locally, the real problem appeared when I deployed the script on our server. The headless mode (used because the server didn’t have a graphical interface) didn’t behave the same as a regular browser.

After lots of analysis, I discovered that some websites can detect headless browsers, leading to blocks. But I couldn’t just disable headless mode on the server because it lacked a display.

🛠️ Solution? PyVirtualDisplay!

PyVirtualDisplay provides a virtual display on a server, allowing Selenium to run in normal (non-headless) mode. 

This solved the problem for 30+ sanctions lists that weren’t being scraped due to headless detection. 

**🔍 Analyzing Chrome Headers for Ultimate Bypass**

There were still some websites that my tools couldn’t bypass. Oddly, these sites worked fine on a regular Chrome browser but not through Selenium. I decided to compare the request headers sent by Chrome vs. Selenium.

I analyzed the headers Chrome used when it successfully loaded the page and copied those exact headers into my Selenium script.

This included headers like:

sec-ch-ua

sec-fetch-dest

sec-fetch-mode

📊 Result: This technique worked! By replicating the exact headers, my requests appeared even more like they were coming from a normal browser, bypassing detection.

**🚧 Still Evolving: Challenges with Cloudflare & Human Verification**

Despite all these advancements, some websites that use Cloudflare or human verification mechanisms still block requests made with Selenium. These sites often present a CAPTCHA or similar human verification challenges.

Currently, I am exploring new ways to tackle these obstacles, potentially involving:

🧠 AI-based CAPTCHA solvers

🕵️ More sophisticated header replication

🌍 Browser fingerprinting techniques

🎉 Summary of My Journey:

🌱 Free Web Proxies: Worked for simple IP-based blocking.

🚀 Fake User Agents & Custom Headers: Helped bypass more sophisticated bot detection.

🔧 Selenium Stealth: Simulated human behavior to evade advanced detections.

🖥️ PyVirtualDisplay: Solved headless detection issues on servers.

🔍 Chrome Header Analysis: Final step in mimicking real browser requests.

🚧 Current Focus: Tackling Cloudflare and CAPTCHA challenges.

💡 Key Takeaways:

Web scraping isn’t just about writing code to fetch data; it’s about continuously learning and adapting.

Each layer of protection on a website teaches new skills and leads to better, more advanced techniques.

Persistence is key, and even when things don’t work, it’s an opportunity to discover something new.

That’s my journey so far, and I’m excited to keep evolving!
